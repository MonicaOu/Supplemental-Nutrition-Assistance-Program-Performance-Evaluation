# Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Performance Evaluation from 2016-2018 in Hennepin County, MN

## Background 
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP for short, is a federal program that provides nutrition benefits to supplement the food budget of needy families so they can purchase healthy food and move towards self-sufficiency. Besides its effect on combating food insecurity, it also serves as one of the most effective ways to stimulate local economics, where each dollar in SNAP benefits generates $1.79 in economic activity. 

Statistics show that 1 in 8 Minnesotans is affected by hunger or faced with some level of food insecurity. They either do not have enough food to eat, or they have to sacrifice their nutrition needs because of a low budget. So far, SNAP has reached out to 7% households and 400, 101 individuals on a monthly basis, but there are people still struggling to fulfill their nutrition needs, either because they are unaware of SNAP or need help filling their applications. In order to best assist Hennepin County to target eligible person, we first need to evaluate SNAP Performance 

## Problem Definition
Historically, Hennepin County has been using internal metrics such as “how fast the process of an application” to define success, and focused mainly on people who are already in the program. With the lack of a consistent success measurement, Hennepin County struggles to identify and target people that suffer from food insecurity. In order to understand the gap between people that are eligible for SNAP and those who are already in the program, we decide to come up with two performance metrics on Census Tract level. One is the penetration rate, defined as the number of enrolled divided by number of eligible; the other is the number of people that are missing out from SNAP. With these two success measurements, we further analyze any disparities across geographics and demographics, and provide actionable insights to improve SNAP uptake.
